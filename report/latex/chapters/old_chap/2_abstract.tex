\section{Abstract}
\noindent VGU Bus Ticket Booking System is a web application that uses a combination of PHP, HTML, and CSS for the front-end, and JavaScript for the back-end. This system provides VGU students with a convenient way of booking daily buses for transport from the campus in Binh Duong to Ho Con Rua in Ho Chi Minh City. The administrators of the system can also manage the system better compared to the current method of using Google Forms.\\
The information of the students and tickets are stored using a relational database (MySQL), hosted by phpMyAdmin.
This project is made for the Programming Exercise module, which is evaluated by Professor Huynh Trung Hieu. The purpose of this module as well as this project is for us to have the in-hand experience in developing projects.
