\section{Conclusion}

    \subsection{What do we achieve objectives}
     %  \item We would like to group together users with similar viewing patterns in order to recommend similar content (genres). By asking different questions about age, genre, hobbies, we can collect data and conclude some insights.
    From conducting the survey, preparing data, analyzing input, to visualize attributes by histograms, our team can identify the relation between viewing patterns(age, film genre, working field, frequency, factor) and we can recommend contents base on that insight. For that reason, our team have achieved our project goals and objectives.
    
    \subsection{Future Work}
    Refining clustering algorithms, adding more features, or expanding the recommendation system's capabilities are admirable improvements for this project. Other potential areas can be building the movie recommendation web app, testing our recommendation, accuracy; as well as implementing other methods to analyse data such as non-hierarchical clustering, comparing the result between two methods.
